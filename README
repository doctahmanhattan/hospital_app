####Best Hospital Finder Shiny App
Overview
The Best Hospital Finder Shiny App helps users find the best hospital in their state for a specific illness. Users simply need to enter their state's initials and the illness they are interested in, and the app will provide the name of the best hospital in that state for treating the illness.

Requirements
R (version 3.6 or higher)
Shiny package
dplyr package
Installation
Ensure that you have R installed on your computer. You can download it from CRAN.

#Install the required R packages if you haven't already:
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("dplyr")

Running the App
Save the app code in a file named app.R.

Ensure that you have the hospital_data data frame available in your R environment. This data frame should contain the columns State, Illness, and Hospital.

Run the Shiny app using the following command in your R console:
shiny::runApp("path/to/your/app.R")

Replace "path/to/your/app.R" with the actual path to your app.R file.

Usage
Enter State Initials:

In the "Enter State Initials" field, input the two-letter initials of your state. For example, CA for California, NY for New York.
Enter Illness:

In the "Enter Illness" field, input the name of the illness you are interested in. The input is case-insensitive, meaning you can type Cancer, cancer, or CANCER.
Submit:

Click the "Submit" button to find the best hospital in your state for the specified illness.
View Results:

The app will display the name of the best hospital in your state for the illness you entered.
Example
Enter CA in the "Enter State Initials" field.
Enter cancer in the "Enter Illness" field.
Click the "Submit" button.
The app will display: "The best hospital in CA for cancer is: UCLA Medical Center."
Data Format
Ensure your hospital_data data frame follows this structure:

State	Illness	Hospital
CA	cancer	UCLA Medical Center
NY	cardiology	New York-Presbyterian
TX	neurology	Houston Methodist
...	...	...
Troubleshooting
No matching hospital found: Ensure the state initials and illness are entered correctly.
App not running: Verify the path to the app.R file and ensure all required packages are installed.
