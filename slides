## R Markdown
Creating a Shiny app to achieve this involves building a user interface (UI) to collect user inputs (state initials and illness) and a server logic to process these inputs and provide the relevant hospital information. Below is a basic implementation of such an app in R.

First, you'll need a dataset containing information about hospitals and the illnesses they specialize in for each state. For the sake of this example, let's assume you have a data frame named hospital_data with columns: State, Illness, and Hospital.

Here is the Shiny app code

## Slide with Bullets

- Replace the sample hospital_data data frame with your actual data containing state, illness, and hospital information.
- The tolower function ensures that the illness input is case insensitive.
- The 'eventReactive' function ensures that the hospital search is performed only when the submit button is pressed.

## Slide with R Output

```
library(shiny)
library(dplyr)

# Sample data frame (replace this with your actual data)
hospital_data <- data.frame(
  State = c("CA", "NY", "TX", "CA", "NY", "TX"),
  Illness = c("cancer", "cardiology", "neurology", "cardiology", "cancer", "neurology"),
  Hospital = c("UCLA Medical Center", "New York-Presbyterian", "Houston Methodist", "Stanford Health Care", "Mount Sinai", "UT Southwestern")
)

# Define UI for application
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # Application title
  titlePanel("Best Hospital Finder"),
  
  # Sidebar layout with input and output definitions
  sidebarLayout(
    
    # Sidebar panel for inputs
    sidebarPanel(
      textInput("state", "Enter State Initials (e.g., CA for California):", ""),
      textInput("illness", "Enter Illness:", ""),
      actionButton("submit", "Submit")
    ),
    
    # Main panel for displaying outputs
    mainPanel(
      textOutput("result")
    )
  )
)

# Define server logic
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  # Reactive expression to process the user input and find the best hospital
  result <- eventReactive(input$submit, {
    state <- toupper(input$state)
    illness <- tolower(input$illness)
    
    # Assuming 'hospital_data' is your data frame containing hospital info
    hospital <- hospital_data %>%
      filter(State == state, tolower(Illness) == illness) %>%
      select(Hospital) %>%
      slice(1) %>%
      pull()
    
    if (is.null(hospital)) {
      return("No matching hospital found.")
    } else {
      return(paste("The best hospital in", state, "for", illness, "is:", hospital))
    }
  })
  
  # Output the result
  output$result <- renderText({
    result()
  })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```
